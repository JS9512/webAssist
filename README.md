# webAssist

webAssist is a simple WebView wrapper for Android

This is a stripped down and modified version of https://github.com/woheller69/gptAssist and https://github.com/woheller69/huggingAssist, born as a hobby project for personal need.

It may evolve to be customizable enough to be a featured light browser for any kind of website you may need to see.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JS9512/webAssist`
2. Change the main URL to your preferred one by modifying the "urlToLoad" string in MainActivity.java file. You can also choose to exclude all the other domains and set a whitelist to unblock specific websites if you need to.
3. Build the app: `gradlew assembleDebug`
